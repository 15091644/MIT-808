# MIT-808 - SDG Goals

## About

This repository handles the MIT 808 data science project.

Here the South African SDG Hub has created a metadatabase that contains paper abstracts, along with paper titles, and the associated classification of the article to a SDG goal. The aim of this project is to create a search engine that returns the most appropriate articles based on a user query.
