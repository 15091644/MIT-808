# MIT-808 - SDG Goals

## About

This repository handles the MIT 808 data science project.

Here the South African SDG Hub has created a metadatabase that contains paper abstracts, along with paper titles, and the associated classification of the article to a SDG goal. The aim of this project is to create a search engine that returns the most appropriate articles based on a user query.

The website of the South African SDG Hub can be found here: https://sasdghub.up.ac.za

## TODO:

1. Set up a compatible requirements.txt file

## Setting up:

1. After cloning the repository open anaconda prompt and navigate to the local repo on your desktop
2. Create a virtual environment using conda using the following steps:
3. conda create -n MIT808
4. Then once created: conda activate MIT808. You are now working with a separate controllable library environment in python.
5. conda install --yes --file requirements.txt to install the required dependencies
6. Separately install pytorch on conda using the following command depending on the GPU you have:

This is for windows:

CUDA available:

conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch

conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch

if CPU only:

conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch

Please see https://pytorch.org/ if you have another operating system.
